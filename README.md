# HTML-challenge: Module 11
In this challenge, we use HTML code to perform web scraping of the Mars News Website. 
Using the data found at the links provided, we scrape titles and preview text from Mars News, as well as integrating pandas and the matplotlib library to perform analyses.

For this challenge, I reviewed the class recordings and activities from Module 11, as well as pandas documentation to remind myself of syntax on pandas and matplotlib.
